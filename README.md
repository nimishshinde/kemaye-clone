## Lessons Learned

We are in our learning phase and this is our 2nd clone using react and 1st clone with backend and database, so faced multiple issues to build this site. These are some topic that challenges us to make this:-
- Making Proper Database using mongodb and deploying it in Mongo Atlas
- Making Backend using Express and Deploying in Heroku and making Api
- Making specific cartitems for individual users
- Playing with animation to get desired output
- Using redux to manipulate the features
- Making custom filters
- Using various styling method so that our clone could look as original as possible
